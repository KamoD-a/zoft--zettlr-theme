# Dark Mode Theme for Zettlr

[Zettlr][https://www.zettlr.com/] is an opden-source note-taking, organizing and publishing app. 
I made a modern theme for this amazing app.
Just copy the content in the custom.css file into your app.

!WARNING! At the moment only the dark mode is supported!

# Changing the accent color:

To change the accent color from darkolivegreen to any color you want, just change the value of the color variable --system-accent-color to any value you'd like :)
